#Exploratory Data Analysis Week 1 Assignment

Here we have created 4 R files to generate 4 different plots using data on electric power consumption from the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set".
Information on the data used, steps and plots can be found under CodeBook.md

## Instructions
* Download the plot R file required to your working directory
* Load the file into R. E.g. `source(“./plot1.R”)`
* Run the plot script. E.g. `plot1()`
  * Note: this may take some time on first run as it will download the source data to the `./data` directory within your working directory.
* Access the generated file in your working directory. E.g. ./plot1.png
